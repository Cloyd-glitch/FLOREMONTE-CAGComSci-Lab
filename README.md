The results demonstrate a clear inverse relationship between the number of decimal places used and the magnitude of the error. As shown in the data matrix, increasing the precision from 20 to 100 decimal places resulted in an exponential reduction in error, dropping from approximately 3.52 * 10^-(15) to as low as 2.38 * 10^(-95). 
Regarding the comparison of methods, the visualization confirms that rounding is consistently more accurate than truncation. While the errors were identical at 20 decimal places (likely due to the specific value of the 21st digit of pi being less than 5), a clear divergence appeared at higher precisions.
This trend is visually represented in the graph, where the blue dashed line (Rounding) consistently tracks below the red solid line (Truncation), indicating a smaller deviation from the true value. Therefore, while higher precision is the primary factor in reducing error, employing a rounding strategy provides a measurably superior approximation compared to simple truncation.
